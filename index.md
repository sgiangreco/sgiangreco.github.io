## Week 1

I have begun reading through _Stochastic Local Search - Foundations and Applications_ by Hoos and Stuetzle.  
It introduced the propositional satisfiability (SAT) and Traveling Salesman problem (TSP) as prototypical combinatorial problems.  
I have also begun reading about different basic iterative methods for effectively exploring a search space and how they compare to each other.
Examples are best improvement, first improvement, variable neighborhood descent (VND), and variable depth search (VDS).

Next week, I will continue reading through the book and attempt to start writing code for some of the basic methods I encounter so as to help ferment my understanding.
I will also attend some presentations on high performance computing at our university's Research and Technology Development conference.
